3. Here is the output of the shell command 'echo $HOSTNAME': 
opal.clear.rice.edu

4. My shell prompt looks like "/mnt/c/Users/caira$" 
Here is the command I use to (temporarily) 
change my shell prompt to my username with a ">": 
export PS1="\u >". Now my shell prompt is "caira >".

#Then it needs to compile project.tex using pdflatex so all 
#auxiliary build files are contained in .build directory 
#but project.pdf is contained in the original directory. 
#Then commit this script to caam-519-submissions/homework-2

#One way that my code could cause a problem for someone is that
#I denote a particular directory that only exists on this 
#computer and I don't make it possible for someone 
#else to offer a different original directory. 
#The second way that my code could be confusing is 
#that I just have someone put something into a 
#random .tex file but I don't provide any 
#indication of what exact lines 
#need to be added to have a functional 
#and correct .tex file.
